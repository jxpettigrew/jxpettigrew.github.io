## About me
Attempting to conquer the world of tech, one desperate Google search at a time. Focusing on security right now.

I love puzzles, games, and learning things. If the world were a little less interesting, I'd probably get a lot more done.

### Currently Working on
- Studying for Security+
- Building a computer from basic logic gates along with [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
- Working through [THM's SOC Level 1 path](https://tryhackme.com/r/path/outline/soclevel1)
- Brushing up on Linux at [OvertheWire Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)


## About the blog
I'm starting this blog mostly because I want a deeper understanding of computers and networks, how to hack them and how to defend them. If anything I write here ends up helping anyone else, I'll consider it a happy bonus.

### What topics will I write about here?
- **Capture the Flag challenges.**
- **Various tech projects.**
- **Tech news and related topics.**
- **Video games (if I can't help myself).**

### Why am I doing this?
- **Active learning.**
- **Focus and accountability.**
- **Project documentation.**
- **Knowledge repository**
- **Community.**
