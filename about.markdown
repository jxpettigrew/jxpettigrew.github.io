# About

## About the blog

### What topics will I write about here?
- **Capture the Flag challenges.** This is how I got interested in cybersecurity in the first place, and I find they're the best way to quickly assimilate knowledge and put it to use.
- **Various tech projects.** Not sure I'll have a specific direction with these at first. I just want to play around with things to get a better idea of how they work.
- **IT concepts, news, and resources.** Aside from directly putting them to use, I really believe trying to explain concepts is the best way to learn them. If I write about something fairly basic that's covered in dozens of other easily accessible sites, I'm probably just trying to understand it better myself.
- **Strategies for learning.** I'm fascinated by the processes of learning and skill mastery, and that's the underlying motivation of this whole blog, so I'm sure the topic will come up occasionally.
- **Video games??** I don't quite know yet! Maybe not directly related, but if I'm playing something that fits here somehow, why not? Zachtronics stuff, Factorio, Turing Complete, maybe just particularly good puzzle or strategy games -- maybe they're relevant, maybe I just want to talk about video games.

### Why am I doing this?
- **Learning and skill-sharpening.**
- **Focus and accountability.**
- **Documentation of my projects and interests.**
- **Repository of knowledge for my future self.**
- **Resource for others.**
- **Community.**

## About me
Just a computer science grad and former librarian trying to learn as much about cybersecurity and machine learning as I can.

I love puzzles, games, and trivia. I wish the world were a little less interesting because I'd probably be able to get a lot more done.

### What I'm doing right now
- Studying for Security+
- Working through [THM's SOC Level 1 path] (https://tryhackme.com/r/path/outline/soclevel1)
- Building a computer from basic logic gates along to [Nand2Tetris] (https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
- Brushing up on Linux at [OvertheWire Wargames] (https://overthewire.org/wargames/)
