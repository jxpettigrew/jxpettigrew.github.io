## Me
I love puzzles, games, and learning things. If the world were a little less interesting, I'd probably get a lot more done.

### Currently
- Studying for Security+
- Building a computer from basic logic gates along with [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)
- Working through [THM's SOC Level 1 path](https://tryhackme.com/r/path/outline/soclevel1)
- Brushing up on Linux at [OvertheWire Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)


## The blog
I'm starting this blog mostly because I want a deeper understanding of computers and networks, how to hack them and how to defend them. If anything I write here ends up helping anyone else, I'll consider it a happy bonus.

### What I'm writing here
- **Capture the Flag challenges**
- **Various tech projects**
- **Security news and related topics**

### Why I'm writing here
- **Active learning**
- **Information and resource archiving**
- **Personal project documentation**
- **Focus and accountability**
- **Community**
